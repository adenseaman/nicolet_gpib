turn on the PC
turn on the scope
attach the GPIB cables
try to read device #14
it'll probably fail with a BUS ERR, so unplug the cable and plug it back in
try reading it again.  If it fails again, it should be an OS ERR this time
just keep trying to read, replugging and cable, and restarting the scope until it works.
